Developed an LLVM-based C++ library for writing dynamic AMD GPU instrumentation tools.

Leveraged LLVM Machine Modules to disassemble user binaries and inline optimized instrumentation code.

Implemented an API filtering system enabling tool writers to instrument specific AMD GPU function events.

Advised by Dr. David Kaeli in the Computer Architecture Lab at Northeastern Universityâ€™s College of Engineering.

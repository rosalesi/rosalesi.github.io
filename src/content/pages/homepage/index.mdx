Hi, I'm an MSCS student at Duke passionate about low-level systems.

I studied Computer Science at Northeastern University, where I researched AMD GPU instrumentation at the Computer Architecture Lab.

Previously, I interned at Google, optimizing Chrome’s Windows build for binary size, and at Microsoft, where I deployed an active monitoring service to the cloud.

Outside of software, I enjoy chess, poker, and kickboxing.
